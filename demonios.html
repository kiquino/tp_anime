        <h1>Demonios</h1>

        <p>Demons (é¬¼ Oni?) are a race of monstrous, immortal and malevolent beings and one of the major antagonists of
            the series.
            <br>

            Most Demons possess a murderous instinct to kill and devour humans, and have lost most of their memories
            from their human life. Demons however do still retain their original personality, except it often turns into
            a twisted, dark version of what it used to be. However, there are a few Demons who have completely retained
            their human emotions and memories, such as Nezuko Kamado, Tamayo and Yushiro.</p>

                    <div class="desc">Nezuko grew up on a mountain alongside her older brother, Tanjiro, and the rest of
                        her siblings and mother, as the eldest daughter of the Kamado family. She presumably took care
                        of her younger siblings as an assistant to her mother, as is briefly witnessed prior to her
                        family's death. Unlike Tanjiro, who was responsible for selling firewood in town, Nezuko would
                        usually help out around the family home.
                        <br>

                        The family was somewhat poor and, as a result, Nezuko sometimes had to go without things like
                        new clothes in order to ensure that the rest of her siblings had enough food to eat. She did not
                        appear to view this as a burden, and instead was simply just content with helping her family.

                    <div class="desc">When Muzan was in his mother's womb, his heart stopped multiple times. He was said
                        to have been stillborn, having no pulse and not breathing. However, when he was taken to be
                        cremated, he released his first cries.

                        As a young human man, Muzan was diagnosed with a disease that would kill him before he reached
                        the age of 20. The doctor treating Muzan gave him a special prototype medicine. In a fit of
                        rage, resulting from his worsening condition, Muzan killed the doctor. However, only after
                        killing the doctor did he realize that the medicine was actually working and had helped him
                        acquire a strong body. Muzan had no problems adjusting to having to kill other humans for
                        survival, but the problem he faced was the fact that he was unable to walk in the sun. The sun
                        was fatal to him, forcing him to resort to doing his activities only during the night, a
                        condition that he resented. It was during this moment that he truly regretted killing the
                        doctor before he could have finished his treatment with his "Blue Spider Lily" medicine. He
                        searched the entire country for the flower, but couldn't find it. Due to this, Muzan started to
                        create more Demons and planned to spread them in the world, hoping that one of them would
                        eventually find a way to overcome the sun or at least help him on his quest to find the Blue
                        Spider Lily. In order to turn himself into a truly perfect being, he continued his search for
                        hundreds of years.

                        was a married woman with children.

                        Shortly before she became a Demon, Tamayo fell ill with a life-threatening disease and began
                        seeking a cure, which is how she first came across Muzan Kibutsuji. Hiding his true intentions,
                        Muzan offered to treat Tamayo's illness and, when she naively accepted, swiftly converted her
                        into a Demon and left her to run rampant around the town. It's noted that she killed not only
                        her husband and children while on this rampage, but also a number of other humans after the
                        realization of what she'd done to her family sunk in and she fell into a void of despair.</div>

                        that even the very act of walking and breathing was difficult for him to do, causing him to
                        spend a majority of his life trapped within his home being cared for by his mother and father
                        who despite his frailty deeply loved and cherished him.
                        <br>

                        One night, Rui was approached by Muzan Kibutsuji who then offered to "save" him and transformed
                        him into a demon. Now possessing a strong body Rui was finally able to move about freely for the
                        first time bringing joy and happiness to his parents. However, this did not last, as he was now
                        a demon Rui now needed to obtain sustenance by eating humans which then caused him to kill a man
                        inside his home. This bloody scene was then discovered by his parents who were immediately
                        horrified by what their son had done. That night his father and mother agreed that Rui had to be
                        stopped and attempted to kill him in his sleep to prevent him from doing anything worse in the
                        future.</div>
