        <p>The Demon Slayer Corps (鬼き殺さつ隊たい Kisatsutai?) is an organization that has existed since ancient times,
            dedicating its existence to protecting humanity from Demons.

            There are hundreds of Demon Slayers within the organization, however they are not officially recognized by
            the government. With Muzan Kibutsuji's demise and the near-extinction of the Demon race, the Corps
            officially disbanded.</p>

                        eldest child of the Kamado family. At some point in his life, his father, Tanjuro Kamado, passed
                        away, which led to his siblings treating him as a father figure.
                        <br>

                        Tanjiro was very loving towards his siblings, going out of his way to care for them. When one of
                        his brothers accidentally knocked over a kettle, he protected him and received a burn scar on
                        his forehead as a result. Tanjiro was responsible for selling charcoal in the nearest town in
                        order to earn money for the family and appeared to frequent the town quite often, as the
                        civilians there easily recognised him and regularly asked for his help.</div>

                    <div class="desc">Zenitsu was not raised by his parents so he did not have any proper guidance. When
                        he was young, Zenitsu fell in love with a girl and decided to give her money to appeal to her,
                        however the girl ended up running away with another guy leaving Zenitsu drowning in debt.[1]
                        Seeing that he was in financial trouble with debt collectors, Jigoro Kuwajima paid off the debt
                        for Zenitsu and decided to train him as a swordsman.

                        Zenitsu began to refer to Jigoro as 'Gramps' and began to train alongside Gramps' other
                        disciple, Kaigaku. One day when he was training, Zenitsu climbed up a tree out of fear that he
                        was being trained to death and as he began to panic, a stroke of lightning hit him causing his
                        hair to turn blonde.

                        Zenitsu and Kaigaku hated each other. However, Zenitsu still respected him as his senior and for
                        his strong ambition. Zenitsu wished to fight alongside Kaigaku as equals one day and developed
                        his own seventh form, Honoikazuchi no Kami.</div>

                        was revealed later that he was born into a family with an abusive father and escaped from his

                        Afterwards, Inosuke—who was still an infant at the time—and his mother were taken in by Doma
                        into his Paradise Faith cult. Kotoha loved to sing to Inosuke but would apparently change the
                        song lyrics each time. However, after finding out that Doma ate his worshippers, Kotoha fled
                        with her son. Running aimlessly for a human village, Kotoha eventually ended up at the top of a
                        cliff. Seeing no escape route, she made a last-ditch effort to save Inosuke by dropping him into
                        the river below the cliff. She was then devoured by Doma. Later on, Inosuke was discovered and
                        raised by the boars.</div>

                    <div class="desc">Kanao lived an impoverished lifestyle before she was taken in by Kanae Kocho and
                        Shinobu Kocho. Her parents were incredibly abusive towards her and her siblings, beating them
                        and drowning them if they did anything they disliked. Even crying or making sounds of pain would
                        result in a punishment by the parents. She broke psychologically, becoming an empty shell who
                        was sold off into slavery.
                        <br>

                        As she was being led off, tied around the waist by a rope held by her purchaser, they were
                        approached by the Kocho sisters. After confirming she was a slave, Shinobu distracted the man by
                        flinging money in the air. When he released the rope in surprise, she grabbed it and the sisters
                        escape with Kanao to the Butterfly Mansion. Soon after, the sisters discover the extent of her
                        trauma, which makes Shinobu view her as useless, if not potentially dangerous. Kanae,
                        unperturbed, gives Kanao a coin and instructed her to flip it if she ever needs help making a
                        decision.
                        <br>

                        She entered the Demons Slayers, since she wasn't able to do any housework or nursing at the
                        Butterfly Mansion like Aoi and the others could. Kanae and Shinobu didn't condone it, but Kanao
                        learned the Flower Breathing just by watching them, and she took the selection exams without
                        their permission. <br>

                        After Kanae was killed by Doma, Kanao was at her grave with the rest of the members of the
                        Butterfly Mansion. Although she was disturbed by her own inability to cry at her beloved
                        sister's death, nobody judged her for it</div>

                    <div class="desc">Genya belonged to a family of seven children with a hardworking mother who never
                        slept and an abusive father who would beat her and his children. Despite his father often
                        beating both Genya’s mother and siblings his mother always protected them; which he greatly
                        admired, calling his mother “amazing”. His father was hated among the villagers and was
                        eventually stabbed to death by an unknown assailant. After that, Sanemi and Genya vowed to
                        protect their siblings and mother together.
                        <br>

                        One day, their mother didn’t come back home, and eldest sibling Sanemi left to find her. As
                        suspicion and worry began to cross the minds of the children since their mother “was never this
                        late before.” Genya tried his best to reassure them, saying that they were “tired” and advised
                        his siblings to go to sleep. Alone and unprotected, a sudden loud knock was heard from their
                        door. Four of his siblings ran to the door despite Genya's protests and warnings that it might
                        not be their mother, but before he could react the door is sliced open and they were cut down
                        immediately. During that moment Genya’s cheek was cut, forming a scar that goes across his face
                        in the future. In the ensuing panic, Genya watched helplessly as the dark figure which he
                        assumed to be a wolf attacked them. Before it could attack Genya however, Sanemi tackled it out
                        of their window to the streets below and ordered Genya to run away.</div>
